-- suppliers_is_our_page_not_a_shops
--
-- 2026-09-27: the supplier landing pages ship (owner: "now"), so `suppliers`
-- becomes a real top-level route and must stop being a word the shop-address
-- mint can hand out. A shop address is IMMUTABLE once minted.
--
-- Verified in production before writing this, by querying rather than assuming
-- (2026-09-27):
--
--   select (select count(*) from vendor_profiles where lower(business_slug)='suppliers'),
--          (select count(*) from events where lower(slug)='suppliers'),
--          business_slug_is_reserved('suppliers');
--   → 0 · 0 · false
--
-- 🔑 THE BODY BELOW IS `pg_get_functiondef` READ OUT OF PRODUCTION TODAY — it
-- matched 20271208401830 word for word — plus the one new word. Same reason as
-- that file: two same-day replacements of this function once silently deleted
-- each other's words. If another migration replaces it before this merges,
-- re-read the live definition and re-diff before pushing.
