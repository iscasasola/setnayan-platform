/**
 * Setnayan AI — the single governing gate for the whole app.
 *
 * `isSetnayanAiActive(event)` is the ONE place the app asks "is Setnayan AI on
 * for this event?" Every personalization / matchmaking surface gates on it:
 * vendor ranking + the "% match" pill, the reception-proximity sort, recommended
 * + statutory deadlines, the "👀 eyeing your date" nudge, best-match auto-inquiry.
 *
 * When it returns FALSE the experience is the GENERIC search — region-scoped
 * browse, no proximity ranking, no scores, no nudges. The free floor stays on
 * regardless (region filter + anti-double-book availability).
 *
 * Two sources, selected by the `SETNAYAN_AI_PAYWALL_ENABLED` flag (owner
 * 2026-06-08, "govern now free, monetize next" — build behind a flag):
 *   • Paywall OFF (default) — the free Assisted↔Manual toggle (`planning_mode`).
 *     Nothing about the live experience changes.
 *   • Paywall ON — AI also requires a PURCHASED per-event entitlement
 *     (`events.setnayan_ai_active`, stamped when a paid SETNAYAN_AI order is
 *     confirmed). Flip deliberately, coordinated with /pricing + homepage copy.
 *
 * Swapping the source is this one file — every call site is untouched.
